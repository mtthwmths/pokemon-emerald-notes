    - frozen notes on this team
  > I know the EV Spread of Latias is kind of confusing. I tested a lot of EV Sets online, to see which will give Latias, a good Stat Coverage, and this is the best i came up with. The Tactic for this team, is actually very slow (a fight takes 5-10min) but it's so worth it. You start off with Alakazam's Trick Move. The enemy now gets the Choice Band and can only use one Move for the rest of the Battle. If Alakazam survives the Hit, try to paralyze the Enemy, then set up a Reflect and lower it's Accuracy with Kinesis as often as possible. Usually Alakazam survives only one turn, so be aware of that. Also, never give a Metagross the Choice Band. With his Ability Clear Body, you cannot lower his Stats and lowering Stats is crucial for this Team. If you Face a Metagross as first Pokemon, try to setup a Thunderwave or a Reflect, so Umbreon has it easier against it.
  >
  > The Strategy of this Team in Detail Step 1: Alakazam uses Trick. If Alakazam uses more then one turn, use Thunderwave, followed by Reflect (if the Enemy is a physical Sweeper) and/or Kinesis. Step 2: If Alakazam faints or has setup everything that is mentioned in Step 1, switch to Umbreon. Step 3: If the Enemy is a Physical Sweeper, use Charm three times, to lower it's attack by six Stages and then use Double Team six times and then Curse six times. If the Enemy is a Special Sweeper, only use Double Team six times in a row, followed by Curse six times. Step 4: Use Baton Pass to Switch to Latias Step 5: Set Up a Substitute. My Latias had 141 HP, so it could Setup 4 Substitutes without Recover. Always have a Substitute up, trust me on that. Step 6: Use Calm Mind six times. Step 7: Use Recover to get your Health back Step 8: Sweep through the whole Team with a Latias, that has +6 in Atk/Sp. Atk/Def/Sp.Def/Evasion and a Substitute up.

### Notes

exarion provides a listing of what his stats should be when he gets to battle frontier.

> Latios | Modest | 29/21/15/31/23/29 | 20/0/4/252/4/228 | 157/94/93/200/127/158
> Metagross | Adamant | 27/25/29/11/28/31 | 44/252/0/0/0/212 | 159/202/149/94/109/117

werster lists what frames he is shooting for to get certain stats.
> Q: What frame are you trying to hit?
> A: Mudkip: Frame 3253 Lonely 22/31/27/31/31/23
> Beldum: Frame 841 Adamant 29/29/8/17/23/17
>
> Q: Why don't you do this for Latios?
> A: The issue with this is Latios's stats are generated when you say "BLUE" to your mother to make him appear. He takes a while to find, so if you miss it takes forever to retry, and hitting the frame is a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. The one I try to hit is this one
> Latios: Frame 2859 Modest 26/4/22/28/18/30

frozen effect gives a brief breakdown of how to use his silver team
> The Team consists of a Physical Sweeper that can almost One-Shot everything with Double-Edge, a special Sweeper, with a wide coverage of moves and a Defensive Wall, that can Toxic Stall. Of course you can use whatever Team you want, the one mentioned above is just a suggestion. All of them have enough bulk to survive some hits in the early round, aswell as enough Power, to almost 0HKO the Pokemon in the first rounds. If there is something that Latios and Slaking cannot deal with, send in Milotiv, to Toxicstall that Pokemon.

#### breeding
I should get a bunch of dittos, one per nature...

Let's talk dittos.

> So, you find them in the back of the Fossil Maniac's house in Fallarbor town. Just take a boatload of ultra balls and go catch them with reckless abandon. Fill up 3 boxes. You'll have to catch more than you think you will.

You'll want to know where the IV judge is in the Battle Frontier for really getting in the weeds with this breeding thing. It's the house directly above the Pokemon Center, and he's the man seated on the left.

He'll say some things about whatever pokemon you choose from your party, and that's as transparent as the IV's can get in Gen3. In the immortal words of Zuko, "That's rough buddy".

So, here's the table from bulbapedia that has what his words mean:

> Overall IV Total Ratings
>
> Phrase|IV total
> ----|----
> average|0-90
> better-than-average|91-120
> quite impressive|121-150
> outstanding|151-186
>
> Highest Stat

> Phrase|Range
> ----|----
> relatively good|0-15
> quite impressive|16-25
> outstanding| 25-30
> flawless|31



#### Matt's big 3
I didn't start with mudkip, so I have a problem with the exarion strategy...

**Problem:** I need a swampert substitute.

**Brainstorm:** What is Swampert good at?
- [swampert smogon](https://www.smogon.com/dex/rs/pokemon/swampert/)
- resistant to rock and steel
- bulky
- immunity to sandstorm (ground type...)
- decent special attack

**Answer:** Quagsire (and optionally Whiscash)

**Quagsire planning**

**found in:** Safari Zone Extension [surf]
> head up from the entrance then right into the new area.
>
> Quagsire and Wooper are in the southern part of the extension.

run the swampert moveset
- surf
- earthquake
- ice beam
- protect

**final decision(for now)**

- Quagsire (caught in safari zone extension, see above)
  * (leftovers) Sassy EVs[110/56/16/216/113]
  * surf (HM, duh)
  * earthquake (wooper lv. 36/ quagsire lv. 42)
  * ice beam (tm13, 4000c mauville game corner)
  * protect (lilycove dept store 3000p$)

**Latios and Metagross Planning**

good news is, I can just get latios and beldum no issue. so no need to rewrite the plan like I did with swampert...

now then, let's look at those movesets...

+ Latios
  - psychic (lv 40, 3500c mauville game corner)
  - thunderbolt (tm24, 4000c mauville game corner)
  - dragon claw (tm02)
  - calm mind (tm04)


+ Metagross
  - meteor mash (metang level 50)
  - earthquake (tm26)
  - shadow ball (tm30)
  - explosion (move tutor in pacifildog)

that's a *looot* of single use tm and move tutor usage... makes me sad... wonder if there are alternatives...

**latios alternatives**

latios gets dragonbreath instead of dragon claw. it's lower power at 60 to DC's 80 but has more pp...

calm mind is OP, and Dragon Dance at lv 50 is a close second that would at least let you get that speed boost...

or you could use protect in the spot of calm mind and do some scouting with latios...

or recover at lv45 and stay out there a while longer...

**metagross alternatives**

ok so let's look at metagross, cause he's the biggest offender

the easiest case for why I should run the uncapped level categories that starts at lv60 since he doesn't learn meteor mash until 55 if you evolve him asap for the stats

of course you should be able to level him to 50 as normal and then teach him meteor mash with the move relearn tutor for a heartscale

earthquake is there to kill, and I don't know how to replace it

explosion could become hyper beam at lv62, but it does waaay less damage potentially. although if you survive it gives you another turn...

Shadow ball??? I really don't know. he could fight his counter with rock slide 48BP move tutor...

arguably though, this set gets the speedrunners through the entirety of their gold symbols run so I should probably just use it as is...

**what about their EVs?**

name | Nature | ivs | evs | stats at 50
----|----|----|----|----
Latios | Modest | 29/21/15/31/23/29 | 20/0/4/252/4/228 | 157/94/93/200/127/158
Metagross | Adamant | 27/25/29/11/28/31 | 44/252/0/0/0/212 | 159/202/149/94/109/117

so sp atk and speed for latios with a bit of hp and def/sp. def buffing
and atk and speed for metagross with the remainder dumped into hp

exarion gives the frame that he uses to get modest Latios, but I already selected the latios after the elite 4 so I'll just cross my fingers and see how it goes. might be replacing the psychic dragon.

#### Feebas
at some point I would like to have a milotic so that means I'll have to go on the feebas hunt *groan*...

see the appendix for the [feebas](#feebas-1) map that I used.

#### EV Notes

Hotspots for EV Training over Multiple Pokemon

EV | Pokemon | Location | Appearance  Rates | Percent Chance | EVs
---|---------|----------|-------------------|----------------|----
HP | Loudred, Whismur, Ditto | Desert Underpass | 16%, 34%, 50% | 100% to gain HP EVs | 2, 1, 1
Attack | Shuppet, Poochyena, Mightyena | Route 121 | 30%, 20%, 20% | 70% to gain Attack EVs | 1, 1, 2
Defense | Graveler, Geodude, Torkoal | Magma Hideout | 15%, 50%, 35% (Inside Cave) | 100% to gain Defense EVs | 2, 1, 2
Special Defense | Lombre, Lotad, Swablu | Route 114 | 20%, 30%, 40% | 90% to gain Special Defense EVs |	2, 1, 1
Speed | Zigzagoon, Electrike, Wingull, Linoone, Manectric |	Route 118	| 30%, 30%, 19%, 10%, 10% | 99% to gain Speed EVs | 1, 1, 1, 2, 2

Pokemon can only gain a total of 510 EVs spread throughout all six stats, and only a max of 252 EVs can make it onto one stat.

The Macho Brace is an item that will make EV training slightly easier because it doubles the EVs you gain in battle and can be obtained from the Winstrate's House on Route 211 right above Mauville.
